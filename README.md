arim
=====

A Python 3 library for modelling and imaging in ultrasonic testing.

## Features

- 2D forward model for ultrasonic array immersion inspection of small defects,
- multi-view Total Focusing Method imaging for contact and immersion inspections.

## Getting started

Download the latest release and documentation of arim at https://github.com/ndtatbristol/arim/releases

arim includes [example scripts](https://github.com/ndtatbristol/arim/tree/master/examples).

## Installation
